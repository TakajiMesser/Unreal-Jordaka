# Unreal Jordaka

## TODO

* Player health
* Recharging shield (and/or health regen?)
* Enemies (simply rush player and do damage)
* Mouse aim (do we even want aiming? If so, should it turn the character model?)
* Player projectiles (auto or manual aiming/shooting?)
* Player melee attacks (auto or manual?)
* Dodge roll (and/or a block or parry mechanic?)
* Dash move (maybe both quicker dash, and slower roll with i-frames)
* Enemy pathfinding (do we even want anything more complex than just rushing the player?)
* Stats system (e.g. strength, defense, speed, luck, curse, etc.)
* Abilities system (e.g. weapons and items)
* Abilities shop (shop you visit, or between levels, or mid-combat as you level up?)
* Currency (do you get XP? Is XP different from money? Do enemies drop money and/or XP and/or health pickups, or do you find them in the world?)
* Player classes (do we want separate classes/starting characters?)
